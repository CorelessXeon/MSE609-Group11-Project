2. Abstract: The Canadian Digital Health Survey is a series of surveys conducted annually commissioned by Canada Health Infoway (Infoway) through a third-party vendor. These annually conducted surveys are based on a variety of specific system utilization and attitudinal tracking metrics used in previous years as well as new areas of inquiry. The surveys include core tracking questions as well as new questions that will provide actionable insights to help advance the digital health landscape in Canada.

3. Data collection: 25 minute online survey conducted November 28-December 28, 2023. Web survey of 10,130 citizens in Canada over the age of 16. The survey was made available in both English and French. Using Canadian Census data, weighting was applied according to region, age, and gender in order to render a representative sample of the Canadian population. Sample base sizes indicated are unweighted. A margin of error cannot be associated with a non-probability sample in a panel survey. For comparison purposes, a probability sample of this size would have a margin of error ±0.974%, 19 times out of 20.
